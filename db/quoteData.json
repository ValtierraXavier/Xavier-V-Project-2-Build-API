You might want money. Maybe you want women. Or, you might want to protect the world. These are all common things people want. Things that their hearts desire.

In my mind it's the certainty in myself that I possess which allows me to have that kind of mercy or compassion. There's no wavering on that point. It's fixed like the stars.
